Credits:
IsmAvatar <cmagicj@nni.com> as project leader, lead programmer, file format expert,
 philosopher, project politics, and most publicity (both research and release).
TGMG <thegamemakerguru@gmail.com> for various programming,
 and finding ways to break things that I thought couldn't be broken
 and G-Java, which we hope will be incorporated as the primary compiler
 and finding CVS/SVN which helped teamwork and version control
Clam <ebordin@aapt.net.au> from the LGM forum for most of the Save and Load code
 which I then proceeded to break and refix, and most of the MDI desktop,
 and the ResourceFrame and generics, which are still largely suppressed messes.
Quadduc <quadduc@gmail.com> from the LGM forum for technical things
 like format fix, license, legality, bug fixes, and the great GM7 breakthrough;
 almost all of our UI icons, much work on the Frames, and string externalization.

Special Thanks:
DeathFinderxx <deathfinderxx@yahoo.com> for providing the primary resource icons
Josh @ Dreamland <joshv@zoominternet.net> for the interesting history of GameMaker's format.
Lief902 
Professor Mark Overmars <gamemaker@wanadoo.nl> for providing GM6 and its file format
 which inspired this, and then up and deciding to be a jerk about it by the time GM7 came out.
Everyone else from the GMC forums, G-Java forums, LGM forum, etc. who helped out,
 gave tips, acknowledged LGM's presence, or have works that aided in its creation,
