Credits:
IsmAvatar <cmagicj@nni.com> as project leader, lead programmer, and file format expert
TGMG <thegamemakerguru@gmail.com> for various programming,
 and finding ways to break things that I thought couldn't be broken
 and G-Java, which we hope will be incorporated as the primary compiler
 and finding CVS/SVN which helped teamwork and version control
Clam <ebordin@aapt.net.au> from the LGM forum for most of the Save and Load code
 which I then proceeded to break and refix; and starting the MDI desktop
Quadduc <quadduc@gmail.com> from the LGM forum for technical things like format fix and license
 as well as amazing bug fixes, some MDI code/fixes, and string externalization

Special Thanks:
DeathFinderxx <deathfinderxx@yahoo.com> for providing the default graphical icons
Professor Mark Overmars <gamemaker@wanadoo.nl> for providing GM6 and its file format
 which inspired this, and then up and deciding to be a jerk about it by the time GM7 came out.
Everyone else from the GMC forums, G-Java forums, LGM forum, etc. who helped out,
 gave tips, acknowledged LGM's presence, or have works that aided in its creation,
 including but certainly not limited to (and pardon the many forgotten names):
