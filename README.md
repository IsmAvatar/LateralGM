 philosopher, project politics, and most publicity (both research and release).

 which I then proceeded to break and refix, and most of the MDI desktop,
 and the ResourceFrame and generics, and most of our visual components.

 like format fix, license, legality, bug fixes, and the great GM7 breakthrough;
 almost all of our lib icons, much work on the Frames, and string externalization.
* TGMG <thegamemakerguru@gmail.com> for various programming,
 and finding ways to break things that I thought couldn't be broken
 and finding SVN, which helped teamwork and version control.
