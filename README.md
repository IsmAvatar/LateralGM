Contributors
-------
* IsmAvatar <IsmAvatar@gmail.com> as project leader, lead programmer, file format expert,
 philosopher, project politics, and most publicity (both research and release).
* Clam <clamisgood@gmail.com> for most of the Save and Load code
 which I then proceeded to break and refix, and most of the MDI desktop,
 and the ResourceFrame and generics, and most of our visual components.
* Quadduc <quadduc@gmail.com> for technical things
 like format fix, license, legality, bug fixes, and the great GM7 breakthrough;
 almost all of our lib icons, much work on the Frames, and string externalization.
* TGMG <thegamemakerguru@gmail.com> for various programming,
 and finding ways to break things that I thought couldn't be broken
 and finding SVN, which helped teamwork and version control.

* Robert B. Colton added GMX format, Shaders, major bug fixes, and preferences panel.
