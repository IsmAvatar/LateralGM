## Calico Icon Set ##

This project is meant to create a simple, free alternative to icon sets such as Silk, which have licenses just annoying
enough to be GPL-incompatible. While I respect icon authors' wishes to be credited for their work, I also respect free
software programmers who want to release their applications without worring about license violations.

This icon set is hosted on a GitHub repository. https://github.com/enigma-dev/Calico-Icon

All the icons in this set are vectorized, but designed to look good at small resolutions. You can, of course, render them
at larger resolutions, but due to SVG's lack of hinting, this might turn out bad at magnifications under 2x, and due to
their design focus on small resolutions, they might not look that great at larger sizes, anyway, from the 1px lines
accounting for 5% of the icons' screen space.

Presently, this icon set is small. It is designed to suit the needs of various IDEs for the ENIGMA project, and so will
accumulate more icons as the need arises for them in that project. You may request new icons in the tracker.

The icons are designed to be minimal, in the sense that it is easy to change them in bulk in their vector format. SVG is
not a perfect format, but it is much better suited for this than, say, XCF or PSD.

That said, enjoy the icons.
